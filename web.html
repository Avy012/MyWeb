        Hello, My name is Dahee Kim. <br>
        I'm living in Seoul currently taking bachelor's degree program in Hansung University. <br>
        I'm expecting to graduate in June, 2025. <br><br>
        I have a experience of studying abroad at <mark>Northeatsern Illinois University</mark> in USA for a year from 2023 to 2024.<br>
        I took Modern Database Management, Artificial Intelligence, Server Side Web Programming and Event-Driven Programming in Computer Science department. <br>
        As elective classes I took following 4 classes for various reasons:<br>
        Music Theories: I wanted to know more about music theories in general because once I thought about making an AI that categories music genre and makes recommendation to people. <br>
        Public Speaking: I took this class to overcome my anxiety about making public speech. <br>
        Disability Studies: My final goal in this field is developing a technology that can help marginalized people in society. To reach that goal I felt the need to know more about marginalized group, and ended up taking this class.<br>
        Intro to Communication: Knowing communication skills are important in anywhere but it is especially important in this field where most of works are done as group. <br>

    <h3 id="jobTitle">My Job Experience</h3>
    <div class="Info">
        <mark class="yellow">2022.02 - 2022.08</mark> <br>
        I worked part time job at Pizza hut for 6 months. <br>
        It is very small job but during this I dealt with lots of workers and costomers. <br>
        As I worked mainly as a server I learned how to be communicational bridege between costomers and other workers. <br><br>

        <mark class="yellow">2023.03 - 2023.07, 2024.09 - 2024.01</mark><br>
        I worked as a teaching assistant at Hansung University classes for 2 semesters. <br>
        I managed 2 courses, Intro to Web Programming and Computer Programming.<br>
        At Intro to Web Programming they taught basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and Computer Programming was about basic of C. <br>
        I got assigned 80 students to take questions. <br>
        Most of my work was attending classes and helping people doing their assigned project of the week.<br>
        With this job, I could learn how to convey code information to beginner programmers more effectively and easily and review own basic knowledges.<br>
